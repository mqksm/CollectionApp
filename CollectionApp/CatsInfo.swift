    Cat(name: "The Exotic",
        pictureName: "1TheExotic",
        description: "Exotic cats are known for their easy-going nature, rounded 'teddy bear' appearance, and soft coat. They're also great cats for those who love Persians but don't feel up to the grooming demands."),
    Cat(name: "The Ragdoll",
        pictureName: "2TheRagdoll",

        pictureName: "3TheBritishShorthair",
        description: "These cats are quiet and affectionate. They have dense coats, large round eyes, and a sturdy build."),
    Cat(name: "The Persian",
        pictureName: "4ThePersian",
        description: "Persian cats require maintenance for their luxurious coats, which could explain why they're not higher on the list. Cat-owners need to comb their Persians daily and the CFA recommends occasional baths. Persians also prefer not to jump and climb."),

        pictureName: "5TheMaineCoon",
        description: "Maine Coons are large in size and often described by owners as 'dog-like.' They are trainable and smart, and have a unique appearance included tufted paws and big ears."),

        pictureName: "8TheSphynx",
        description: "Sphynx cats are, of course, known for being hairless. Still, their personalities are unique as well: these cats are mischievous and playful and love human company.

    Cat(name: "The Abyssinian",
        pictureName: "9TheAbyssinian",
        description: "Abyssinians are one of the oldest known breeds. They're not lap cats, but they are known for being super intelligent and immensely loyal to their owners."),

        pictureName: "10TheDevonRex",
        description: "With their big ears and thin bodies, they take on an unusual appearance. These cats learn tricks easily, and like their human to be around them always: those who don't spend much time at home should not get this kind of cat.")
